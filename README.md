# Requirements
- Add dark-mode switching functionality to the *existing* dark-mode button found in the ThemeSwitcher component
  - Utilise the *existing* dark-mode scss file by adding a `dark-mode` class to a parent `html` element of the App component
- When in Dark mode:
  - The button icon should be `faSun`
  - The button icon colour should be `(#FFA500)`. You can use the `color` prop on the `Icon` component.
# Think about
- How to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- How to implement dark mode in a bigger application. Would your solution work for this?
